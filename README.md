# AURALITE - Mixed Input Output Bot Automation

## Installation

### Windows

* Please note that all these are extremely necessary for the functioning of the script, otherwise it'll not work (obviously).

#### Python 🐍
Pretty standard and usual, cannot live withou this on your computer, get it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). 

#### Tesseract 🧊
Since the newer versions of tesseract don't have an .exe wrapper. I used [these](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki), also thank you folks of Mannheim University - Germany. 

#### NodeJS 💅🏻
We need it in order to use pip. A huge pain in the ass, would it be to do all that without you pip. We ❤️ you! You can get it, [here](https://nodejs.org/dist/v16.14.2/node-v16.14.2-x64.msi).

#### AutoHotKey ⌨️
This baby right here saves lots, and I mean it, lots of time when it comes to automation. You can get it [here](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-install.exe).

#### Anaconda 🐍🐍🐍
If you want some shortcuts, you may want to install Anaconda, I find it makes some stuff easier to handle. Head [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). 

#### FOR LAZY PEOPLE ONLY
Don't feel like clicking all them links? Shame on you!!I just happened to write a PowerShell Script for you!
Before running it, crack your PowerShell (admin please) and type:

        Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy AllSigned

This command will allow you Shell instance to run Power Shell Script files. It comes unauthorized by default. 

### MacOS
Maybe next time, rich kid!

### Linux
Sorry, I'm working on that.
